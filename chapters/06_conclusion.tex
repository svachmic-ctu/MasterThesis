\chapter{Conclusion}

The aim of this work was to identify disconnected data endpoints and figure out a way how to connect them and make use of them. I demonstrated the need on misunderstandings between different teams and pointed out where value could be more driven.

In the second part, I analyzed the existing tools on the market and I assessed their usability in the given context. Not being fully satisfied with their functions, I took the initiative and designed a system that would be in-house, deployed in the AWS VPC environment. 

In the third and fourth part, I designed and developed the system into a fully viable product (= MVP). As I went along, I kept validating my ideas with my peers and supervisors.

In the last part, I set myself a goal to test the system from many aspects - idea, usabilty and performance. While some tests went better than the others, it brought me so many valuable insights and pointed out places with room for improvement that I hadn't even considered before. For that I see the tests as an immense success, regardless of the actual results - it shows that the idea is valid, people are interested in it and there is something to continue working on.
